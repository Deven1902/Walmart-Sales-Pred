# Conclusion

Here, we tried using 3 different algorithms to understand which model to use to predict the weekly sales.

Linear Regression is not an appropriate model to use as accuracy is very low.

However, Random Forest Regression gives an accuracy of almost 95%. So, it is the best model to forecast weekly sales.
